# Van-Gogh-Checkerboard
This project was done for a school assignment. This code uses random number generation and a nested for-loop to create a Pointillist checkerboard. The program includes a nested for-loop that repeats 8 X 8 = 64 times. The particles are randomly generated, and the colours alternate.
